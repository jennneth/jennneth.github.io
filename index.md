### Full Stack Development 

[Where To Build A Brewery](/https://github.com/jennneth/brewery_location_recommendation/)

Team project where we collaborated on project design, project plan, data ETL from CSV and JSON sources, development of database files, data analysis, FLASK server, and webpage production.

Inspiration:
We are marketing analysts for the “Holy Ale Brewery” and are tasked with identifying and recommending the next 5 cities we should open our new breweries. Using the data sources we will create a dashboard that explains which cities would be an investment opportunity based on population and median household income.
