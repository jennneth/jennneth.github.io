### Full Stack Development 

Summary: 
[Where To Build A Brewery](/https://github.com/jennneth/brewery_location_recommendation/) is a team project where we collaborated on design, planning, data ETL, and engineering to produce a production-ready webpage that identifies good investment opportunities for small businesses. Throughout the process, we extracted data from CSV- and JSON-formatted sources to analyze and display on a webpage served by a Python Flask server.

Inspiration:
We are marketing analysts for the “Holy Ale Brewery” and are tasked with recommending the next 5 cities which would pose good business opportunities for new breweries. Using publicly available data sources:<br>
  Brewery CSV:https://data.world/datafiniti/breweries-brew-pubs-in-the-usa <br>
  Starbucks CSV: https://gist.github.com/dankohn/09e5446feb4a8faea24 <br>
  Census/IRS Data:https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-statistics-2018-zip-code-data-soi <br>
  State-ZipCode GeoJSON: https://github.com/OpenDataDE/State-zip-code-GeoJSON <br>
we created a dashboard that identifies which cities in a list would be good investment opportunities based on population, median household income, and other key demographics. <br>
